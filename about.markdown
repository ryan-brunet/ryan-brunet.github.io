Hi! I'm a PhD student in the University of Melbourne School of Physics studying formation mechanisms for magnetically confined mountains on accreting millisecond pulsars, and their potential to be sources of continuous gravitational wave emission detectable by [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu). I'm interested in astrophysical plasma physics and magnetohydrodynamics, neutron star equations of state, general relativity, numerical modelling, and pubs. I'm a member of [OzGrav](https://www.ozgrav.org).

Here's some papers of interest in the field I spend most of my time in:
- Payne & Melatos (2004): *Burial of the polar magnetic field of an accreting neutron star - I. Self-consistent analytic and numerical equilibria* - [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004MNRAS.351..569P/abstract)
- Priymak, Payne & Melatos (2011): *Quadrupole moment of a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting neutron star: effect of the equation of state* - [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.417.2696P/abstract)
- Kulsrud & Sunyaev (2020): *Anomalous diffusion across a tera-Gauss magnetic field in accreting neutron stars* - [NASA/ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JPlPh..86f9002K/abstract)
